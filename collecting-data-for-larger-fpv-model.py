'''
This file is meant to collect data for the latest model.

The data should be first person view data with the *HOOD CAMERA* in an armored Karuma. 

I mainly train during day, but I would like more data from other times of day/weather, so feel free to submit whatever you like. 

I will check all data for fitment to AI (basically how close does my AI predict the data you submit) to validate 
against people trying to submit bad data. 

When you have some data files, host them to google docs or something of that sort and share with
